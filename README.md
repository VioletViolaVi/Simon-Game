# Simon Game
The app is a re-creation of the classic Simon Game. In producing this game the following were used:
- HTML for the code's basic structure.
- CSS to add style to the code's basic structure.
- SASS to organise the CSS used to style the code's basic structure.
- JavaScript to add the logic and functionality to make the game work.
- jQuery to use shorter lines of code in writing the JavaScript when adding the logic and functionality to make the game work.
- Google Fonts to provide the font used for the game.
